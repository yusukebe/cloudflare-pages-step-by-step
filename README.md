Cloudflare Pages is a great platform for Jamstack, and the "Functions" allow us to make our site dynamic.
This project will show you the path to creating a full-stack application from scratch on Cloudflare Pages.
By integrating these components, it would be possible to create a React SPA application with the API using a D1 database.
